# Project_Prajit
Project_Prajit is a production-ready AI project that allows you to ask questions about your documents using the power
of Large Language Models (LLMs), even in scenarios without an Internet connection. 100% private, no data leaves your
execution environment at any point.

The project provides an API offering all the primitives required to build private, context-aware AI applications.
It follows and extends the [OpenAI API standard](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api),
and supports both normal and streaming responses.

The API is divided into two logical blocks:

**High-level API**, which abstracts all the complexity of a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
pipeline implementation:
- Ingestion of documents: internally managing document parsing,
splitting, metadata extraction, embedding generation and storage.
- Chat & Completions using context from ingested documents:
abstracting the retrieval of context, the prompt engineering and the response generation.

**Low-level API**, which allows advanced users to implement their own complex pipelines:
- Embeddings generation: based on a piece of text.
- Contextual chunks retrieval: given a query, returns the most relevant chunks of text from the ingested documents.

### Motivation behind Project_Prajit
Generative AI is a game changer for our society, but adoption in companies of all sizes and data-sensitive
domains like healthcare or legal is limited by a clear concern: **privacy**.
Not being able to ensure that your data is fully under your control when using third-party AI tools
is a risk those industries cannot take.

### Present and Future of Project_Prajit
Project_Prajit is now evolving towards becoming a gateway to generative AI models and primitives, including
completions, document ingestion, RAG pipelines and other low-level building blocks.
We want to make it easier for any developer to build AI applications and experiences, as well as provide
a suitable extensive architecture for the community to keep contributing.

## ðŸ§© Architecture
Conceptually, Project_Prajit is an API that wraps a RAG pipeline and exposes its
primitives.
* The API is built using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and follows
  [OpenAI's API scheme](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference).
* The RAG pipeline is based on [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/).

The design of Project_Prajit allows to easily extend and adapt both the API and the
RAG implementation. Some key architectural decisions are:
* Dependency Injection, decoupling the different components and layers.
* Usage of LlamaIndex abstractions such as `LLM`, `BaseEmbedding` or `VectorStore`,
  making it immediate to change the actual implementations of those abstractions.
* Simplicity, adding as few layers and new abstractions as possible.
* Ready to use, providing a full implementation of the API and RAG
  pipeline.

Main building blocks:
* APIs are defined in `private_gpt:server:<api>`. Each package contains an
  `<api>_router.py` (FastAPI layer) and an `<api>_service.py` (the
  service implementation). Each *Service* uses LlamaIndex base abstractions instead
  of specific implementations,
  decoupling the actual implementation from its usage.
* Components are placed in
  `private_gpt:components:<component>`. Each *Component* is in charge of providing
  actual implementations to the base abstractions used in the Services - for example
  `LLMComponent` is in charge of providing an actual implementation of an `LLM`
  (for example `LlamaCPP` or `OpenAI`).

## ðŸ¤— Partners & Supporters
Project_Prajit is actively supported by the teams behind:
* [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/), providing the default vector database
* [Fern](https://buildwithfern.com/), providing Documentation and SDKs
* [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/), providing the base RAG framework and abstractions
